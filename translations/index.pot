"(TDWG) organization, and is widely used to publish data within the extended "

"Depending on the type of dataset with which you work, you’ll have to choose "

"linked to one or more Extensions to share more information (such as "
"multimedia links, variables, identification history and so on).\n"
"In some cases, a core can be used as an extension linked to another core: "

"Core to describe the sampled areas and then use the Occurrence Core as an "
"Extension to share the specimens or individuals recorded.\n"
